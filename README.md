# Radiation Dose Tracking System

This repository contains SQL assignment. The aim is to design a simplified radiation dose tracking system for medical imaging. The goal was to track patient exposures across time and ensure annual safety thresholds were not exceeded. 

In this assignment we are tracking: patients, imaging procedures, radiation dose per procedure and dates of exposure. 

## Task 1 — Patient Dose Summary
Selecting patients with total radiation dose > 20 mSv in the last year. Radiation dose for the 1 year period from the current date and number of radiation events per patient, with first and last screening date displayed.
